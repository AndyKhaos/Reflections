Q1) How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

A1) It was much more efficient than finding the differences manually.

Q2) How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

A2) You can view previously saved versions just in case you would like to revert.

Q3) What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

A3) Freedom to use personal judgement when it comes to making a commit. 

Q4) Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

A4) Depends on if files are interrelated. 

Q5) How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

A5) As a reminder, running git log will show a list of the recent commits with information about them, including commit IDs. Running git diff followed by two commit IDs will compare the two versions of the code in those commits. 

Q6) How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

A6) The functionalities of previous commits can be compared using git checkout.

Q7) Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
